took data for 1 micron floating
accidentally started at only saving 1 second, took lots of points, but definitely at end there were multiple beads. not sure at what point

released those and retrapping

going 10 micron down everytime to pull the bead t o the middle of teh water column


at 11:07am, lost and retrapped

laser analysis - has an offset of like 60? so 60 mA is 0 power or osmethighn

for calibration, fit to line and get something of deflection vs laserpower
