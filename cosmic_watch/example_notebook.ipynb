    "```\n",
    "pip install anaconda\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you don't have admin access to your python installation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --user anaconda\n",

    "\n",

    "# Description of what this script does\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to make a plot of the data you collected from your CosmicWatch detector? This script will show you how to do that. It should be pretty straightforward if you understand what information is being saved to the CosmicWatch data file. The trickiest part is properly accounting for the detector deadtime in order to get an accurate rate measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook, you need a CosmicWatch data file. CosmicWatch data files are the .txt files recorded to the microSD card, or the file that was produced when using the import_data.py script. Once you have a file somewhere on your computer, simply input that file into the CWClass below, to make an object that can be used to make different plots. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_data = CWClass('/Users/Spencer/file_location/FileM0001.txt', bin_size = 120)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now tab complete on the my_data variable (after running the cell, shift-enter) to access the different data data parameters. For example, let's say you want to get an array of the measured barometeric pressure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Event_pressures = my_data.pressure_hpa\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The bin_size argument in CWClass is for binning the data into total time intervals, in seconds. For example, if you\n",
    "want to look at the count rate in ten minute intervals, set it to 600. You can then access the binned data with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Binned_data_rate = my_data.binned_count_rate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I've also made some python classes to make different plots. Often, you want to plot multiple files, or sets of data, on the same figure. So my python classes take the input data in as a list. You'll see stuff like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_data2 = CWClass('/Users/Spencer/file_location/FileM0002.txt', bin_size = 120)\n",
    "data = [my_data.pressure_hpa, my_data2.pressure_hpa]\n",
    "colors = ['r', 'b']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the figure is going to plot the pressure from two files, with the first file having a color of red, and the second a color of blue. Eaxmples of this are below.\n"
